This project is a website for my father, who is an artist.  The task was simple enough - make a site that is easy to find that will display the pictures of his work.
The hurdles to overcome were minimizing repeated code, dynamically creating galleries (with no formal attached db), serving large image files quickly, organizing the files according to the client's requests, optimizing for mobile.
To accomplish the task, I created a static database out of a csv file that the client can periocially update.  From this csv, jquery and js are used to open and parse the file, and then to dictate how the site is seen and which galleries to load.
More to come will include an abou the artist, upcoming shows, and potentially more depending on any traction.
Site uses lightbox.js, google analytics, jquery, html5, css, and should look fine for mobile.
